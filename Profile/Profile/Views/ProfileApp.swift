    Over 7 years working with iOS, my first contact with iOS was during the Apple Developer Academy, since then I developed a love by the plataform and Swift ‚ù§Ô∏è. Worked with multiple companies, most of them on the financial area. Still trying to learn how the things work with SwiftUI.
    Besides coding mobile applications, I also like to code games during free time. I had three games published on the App Store. As a requirement during the game development I learned how to draw pixel art, and started to like more games with that art style üëæ.
